# AR Measurement App - Improvements Summary

## ✨ What's New

### 1. **Circular Crosshair** 🎯

- **Center Screen Targeting:** A white circular crosshair with black center dot appears at the center of the screen
- **Precise Aiming:** Helps users accurately target where to place measurement nodes
- **Always Visible:** Crosshair remains visible throughout all measurement states
- **Professional Look:** Clean, unobtrusive design that doesn't interfere with AR content

### 2. **Removed Node Snapping** ❌

- Nodes are now placed exactly at the crosshair center when you tap "New Measurement"
- No more automatic snapping to surfaces
- More precise control over measurement placement

### 3. **Three-Node Measurement System** 🎯

The app now follows a clear 3-step measurement process:

#### **Step 1 - First Node (Red Sphere)** 🔴

- **State:** IDLE → FIRST_NODE
- Press "New Measurement" button
- Places a **red sphere** at the crosshair center on the detected plane
- This marks the base/starting point

#### **Step 2 - Second Node (Green Sphere)** 🟢

- **State:** FIRST_NODE → SECOND_NODE
- Point crosshair at the height you want to measure
- **Real-time preview line** appears from red sphere to crosshair as you move camera
- Press "New Measurement" again
- Places a **green sphere** at the height point
- A **yellow line** connects the red and green nodes
- Calculates and displays the **height measurement**

#### **Step 3 - Third Node (Blue Sphere)** 🔵

- **State:** SECOND_NODE → THIRD_NODE
- Point crosshair at the width you want to measure
- **Real-time preview line** appears from green sphere to crosshair as you move camera
- Press "New Measurement" to finalize
- Places a **blue sphere** for the width corner
- **Closed shape formed** connecting all three points:
  - 🔴 Red → 🟢 Green (yellow height line)
  - 🟢 Green → 🔵 Blue (blue width line)
  - 🔵 Blue → 🔴 Red (blue closing line)
- Calculates **width** and **area** (height × width)### 3. **Plane Detection Progress System** 📊

Before you can measure, the app now ensures proper plane detection:

#### **Scanning Phase**

- When you first open the app, it enters **SCANNING** mode
- A progress card appears at the top showing:
  - "Scanning Environment" title
  - "Move your device around to detect surfaces" instruction
  - **Progress bar** (0-100%)
  - **Percentage indicator** that fills up as you move

#### **How Progress Works**

- The app tracks detected horizontal planes (floors, tables, etc.)
- Progress = detected plane area × movement
- **Green circle indicators** appear on detected planes
- Shows up to 10 circle indicators to avoid clutter
- Once progress reaches **100%**, you can start measuring

#### **Visual Feedback**

- ✅ **Green circles** on detected planes mean the surface is recognized
- 📈 **Progress percentage** shows how much scanning is complete
- 🎯 **"Ready to measure"** toast appears when 100% complete
- 🚫 Button is disabled until scanning is complete

### 4. **Dynamic Area Mesh** 🌐

- In Step 3, before placing the third node, a **cyan semi-transparent mesh** appears
- The mesh dynamically follows your camera movement
- Gives you a real-time preview of the measurement area
- Helps you visualize the final measurement before confirming

### 5. **Clear Visual Feedback** 📱

#### **Color-Coded System:**

- 🎯 **White Crosshair** = Targeting center (always visible)
- 🔴 **Red Sphere** = Base point
- 🟢 **Green Sphere** = Height point
- 🔵 **Blue Sphere** = Width point
- 🟡 **Yellow Line** = Height measurement
- 🔵 **Blue Line** = Width measurement
- 🌊 **Cyan Mesh** = Area preview

#### **Instructions Card:**

- Clear step-by-step instructions at the top
- Updates automatically based on current state
- Shows current measurements when complete

### 6. **Measurements Display** 📏

- **Height:** Displayed on yellow line
- **Width:** Displayed on blue line
- **Area:** Displayed at center with formula (height × width)
- Automatic unit conversion:
  - `< 1m` → shows in **centimeters (cm)**
  - `≥ 1m` → shows in **meters (m)**
  - Area shows in **cm²** or **m²**

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Start the App**

   - Move your device around to scan the environment
   - Watch the progress bar fill up to 100%
   - Green circles will appear on detected surfaces

2. **Place First Point (Base)**

   - Point crosshair at the starting point
   - Tap "New Measurement"
   - Red sphere appears

3. **Place Second Point (Height)**

   - Point crosshair at the height you want to measure
   - **Watch the yellow preview line** extend from the red sphere to your crosshair in real-time
   - Move your camera to adjust the line length and position
   - Tap "New Measurement"
   - Green sphere appears with permanent yellow line showing height

4. **Place Third Point (Width)**

   - Point crosshair at the width you want to measure
   - **Blue preview line appears** from green sphere to crosshair in real-time
   - Move camera to adjust measurement
   - Tap "New Measurement"
   - Blue sphere appears and **closed triangular shape forms** connecting all three points
   - Height, width, and area are displayed

5. **View Results**
   - Height, width, and area are displayed
   - Tap "Clear" to start a new measurement
   - Tap "Finish" to view in scene mode

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

- State machine implementation for clear workflow
- Real-time plane tracking and visualization
- **Real-time line preview** from first node to crosshair position
- **Real-time line preview** from second node to crosshair position
- **Automatic rectangle formation** connecting all three measurement points
- Progress-based UI enabling/disabling
- Dynamic mesh rendering based on camera position
- Proper resource cleanup on measurement reset
- No node snapping - exact placement control
